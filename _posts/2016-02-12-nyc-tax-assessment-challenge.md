## Understanding NYC property tax assessment challenges

### You don't need to let the seemingly complicated tax certiorari process beat you. 

If you are New York City homeowner, sometime after January 15th, you probably received a "[Notice of Property Value](http://nycprop.nyc.gov/nycproperty/nynav/jsp/selectbbl.jsp)" from the city's Department of Finance, showing you the property tax increase you'll face starting July 1, 2016. Coops pay taxes as a building, not individually, though the same tax process applies.

If your taxes jumped, you are not alone. According to the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-property-values-surge-1452907433) assessments increased 10.6% from last year across the city. In Brooklyn, the increase was a staggering 18.2%. In my building, the increase was higher still.

Most people are confused by the jumble of numbers the DoF produces and don't give the assessment a second thought. But the property tax system is not perfect, and conscientious buildings may challenge the city's assessment of their property by hiring lawyers in a proceeding called tax certiorari. These lawyers will take between [12 and 20%](http://cooperator.com/article/challenging-your-real-estate-taxes/full#cut) of the total tax savings, only if they achieve a reduction. Sounds fair, right? Well, it's not that simple.

Let's say, for example, that I have previously been assessed $2 million, and the city raised my assessment to $2.2 million. And let's assume the lawyer is getting 20% of the reduction, which is on the high end, but that is what the poorly-managed attorneys were making off my building. So if the lawyer successfully brought our taxes down $100,000, they'd take 20% of that, but we'd still be up $80,000. Right? No.

There is a state law that they can only implement an increase in our taxes over 5 years. So the hypothetical $100,000 tax savings was only a $20k increase in year 1. **We'd pay the lawyer the entirety of the tax savings**. Then in year 2, the city will very likely raise our taxes again, and the lawyer will again take 20%. This process will go on every year. 

In the [only argument I've seen defending these fees](http://www.habitatmag.com/Publication-Content/Board-Operations/2013/2013-March/Tax-Certiorari-Overcharging#.Vr5hKrkrLu0), an attorney argues your taxes would have been even higher in future years without the challenge. Maybe, but I'm not sure. Using our example, if, in the year after our reduction to $2.1 million, assessments in my neighborhood went up 10% for most people, would my new assessment be $2.31 million? How I read the process is that they would do a fresh evaluation
