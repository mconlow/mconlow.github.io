## A Raspberry Pi Temperature Sensor

When I found out we were having a baby, I immediately clicked into gear and started [reading about how to raise an emotionally well-adjust 7-year old](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=APzgCL8mgHUC&source=productsearch&utm_source=HA_Desktop_US&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=PLA&pcampaignid=MKTAD0930BO1&gl=US&gclid=CNm0mOCktcwCFUWbNwodFWAFBQ&gclsrc=ds). But I was also concerned that the baby's room would be too hot or cold and set out to make my, at the time, new Raspberry Pi into a temperature sensor. 

There are plenty of tutorials on the internet. I am pushing the data to Sparkfun, and visualizing it with Google Charts. Here is the live temperature in my bedroom (or whatever room the Raspberry Pi is currently in):





And just in case I tire of keeping the Raspberry Pi on all the time, here is a screen shot of it:
